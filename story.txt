	In the year of 2100, the environment problem have already threatened the living of human, so people design a 
 robot called Saier, which is used to explore other planets and gather useful resources for human. 

	Saier's first destination was Pluto. Saier was sent there to mine gold.
The Word Space Agency, built in a camera, that would steam Saier's adventures;
however, the stream would be delayed, due to the distance between our planet
and Pluto. One day, while scientists were watching the stream, they realized
small green figures at the background. They checked the date of the steam, it
was a week ago. Scientists immediately sent a signal to Saier to make sure
that the robot was safe. Another week passed, and the scientists still did
not receive a signal back.
