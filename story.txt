	In the year of 2100, the environment problem have already threatened the living of human, so people design a 
 robot called Saier, which is used to explore other planets and gather useful resources for human. 

	Saier's first destination was Pluto. Saier was sent there to mine gold.
The Word Space Agency, built in a camera, that would steam Saier's adventures;
however, the stream would be delayed, due to the distance between our planet
and Pluto. One day, while scientists were watching the stream, they realized
small green figures at the background. They checked the date of the steam, it
was a week ago. Scientists immediately sent a signal to Saier to make sure
that the robot was safe. Another week passed, and the scientists still did
not receive a signal back.
	
	After that, the stream  was also interrupted for a long time, which makes scientists
really worries. Suddenly one day, scientists reveived intermittent signals from Saier.
 Scientists gathered together immediately and they are eager to know what happened during this time.
 However, the signal only last about 30 seconds, and then the communication break again. Due to the bad
communication envitonment, the incoming signal is also vague.
